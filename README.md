# UFOs 
## Module 11 Challenge

## Overview
We have been tasked to help our friend Dana with building a webpage that others can view to access information on UFO sightings. This webpage includes a description of the topic, a table to display the information fromt he source data, and search filters that allow for visitors to update the table based on their search criteria. We will be using Javascript arrays and lists to create tables to organize the UFO information. Then we will implement filters on the table to allow the users to narrow down their searches all within the webpage.

## Summary

One drawback of this webpage is that the search function is case-specific, meaning that it might be harder for users to find the right information if they do not know the dataset as well. 

An additional development that could make this webpage better is a function that would allow for both upper and lower case searches to match each other. Also, being able to trim spaces at the end of words would be helpful.
